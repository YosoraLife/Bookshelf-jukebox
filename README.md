### Plex and Plexamp

For a long time (12+ years) I have been a Plex user for movies and tv series. But I never really used Plex for music before. That was mainly because im terrible at making playlists myself. So often times I would resorted back to listing to the radio and accepting that once in a while I would have to listen to songs i didnt care much for.

This all changed around 2021/2022 when I started to use Plexamp. For me Plexamp is the perfect mix. I always have my personal music with me and I dont have to care about setting up a playlist. Instead, I let myself be surprised (almost always positively) by Plexamps "DJs".

The only thing I really missed in Plexamp was a decent whole home audio setup. And yes of course I used Google Home to play and sync music, but lets be honest, thats not the best of sounds, and also you lose those sweet fades.

But then I heard about an upcoming feature there working on at Plex, whole home audio (see: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_mk_un6L4I&t=1315s) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/plexamp/comments/18orkac/comment/kej64w1/)). And so I started planning my whole home audio setup, starting with this jukebox.

This jukebox is based on the DIY speakers called "[Overnight Sensations](https://sites.google.com/site/undefinition/bookshelf-speakers/diy-overnightsensations)" by Paul Carmody. Those speakers are powered by a Raspbarry Pi with a high quality DAC and Amplifier. The jukebox itself has both physical controls as well as a touchscreen to interface with Plexamp. Futhermore I included a NFC reader. This way I can scan a CD case with NFC sticker to play that CD on Plexamp, or setup NFC cards for different playlists based on my mood.
