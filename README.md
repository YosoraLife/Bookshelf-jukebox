This jukebox is based on the DIY speakers called "[Overnight Sensations](https://sites.google.com/site/undefinition/bookshelf-speakers/diy-overnightsensations)" by Paul Carmody. Those speakers are powered by a Raspbarry Pi with a high quality DAC and Amplifier. The jukebox itself has both physical controls as well as a touchscreen to interface with Plexamp. Futhermore I included a NFC reader. This way I can scan a CD case with NFC sticker to play that CD on Plexamp, or setup NFC cards for different playlists based on my mood.
